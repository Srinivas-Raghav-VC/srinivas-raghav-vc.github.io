## An Essay on a Reflection of Life at This Point

The question one Immanuel Kant asked a noble person, who came to seek advice from him, being not happy even though he had a lot of things that many guys wished for, he was unhappy about his job even though it had all the things people wish for,

Kant talked to the man and asked him this important question about his work. He asked, "Would you do the same job if it had no pay at all? Would you put in the work that you do, for no leverage?"

This question, which is simple yet powerful, showed a deep thought in the noble man. He said, "No."

In the midst of this, all this has shown is that "working on something that the soul of you would never gets bored of, something truly passionate, something that wakes you up at night and days, and time just flies, and there is the flow and ease of the mind—that is the real gift to feel."

In all one lives—4000 weeks roughly, more or so—one can beg to ask: what is a life worth living? cause when I turn 80 and at time of me being on my death bed, all I can ask myself, "was it worth it?"

"Is life worth living ?"
Is to get what you want in life, or is life all about money and the big spends? Is life about lazing around and living a mediocre life, or is life something beyond that we can experience?

I ask this pivotal question, as I turned 20 last month, and really want to reflect on how I will live my next 60.

Life is just a huge load of treks—some are high in slope and some are low in the trench—but for the most part, it is just alright.

In all of the mist of this, one should take a rest and sit in the path and think things through. Reason is more powerful than any emotion, and this is because emotions, though they dictate a lot of things that we humans do in our daily lives, we all want to make sure that "I, the me, is never manipulated to just get someone what he wants." The one of you, the person you represent, must never be in all sense at all loose in control, for someone’s emotional words or conundrum.

A lot of life can be drastically improved if you took the time enough to reason about it and think for yourself. A lot of this is being lost in this modern world, a lot of this is just in shambles—a few come out as thinkers in a thousand—just speaks a lot of today’s problems.

Something I figured out in these few months is that positive thinking and affirmation do help a man to be courageous and have a strong will. In tough times when the will crumbles, we want to lose control of who we are as humans, get into things that we were once addicted to, to lose control of who we are as ourself, to things our mind nonchantably screams of wanting. But during this time, just some positive affirmations on the self can bring gradual changes in the forces of the mind.

A life without sacrifices, pain, and suffering seems really meaningless. A lot of this gives meaning to the life we live. We cry about having to go through a lot to put efforts into doing something, but all this is reflected when we are 80, only to think through then, that "I am glad I did that. I learned a thing or two."

Kant once asked himself when he wasted a day, “What would I be doing each time if I could repeat the same day a hundred times?” And Kant said that things that you would do were all the choices you had, and the most important thing not to forget is that "you still have a choice, to do what you want to get through."

This reminds me of a very important shloka in the Gita:

**कर्मण्येवाधिकारस्ते मा फलेषु कदाचन |  
मा कर्मफलहेतुर्भूर्मा ते सङ्गोऽस्त्वकर्मणि || 47 ||**

_You have a right to perform your prescribed duties, but you are not entitled to the fruits of your actions. Never consider yourself to be the cause of the results of your activities, nor be attached to inaction._

Inaction for me happens when the task at hand is sort of making me uncomfortable and difficult, or feels like giving partial efforts and not being fully invested.

If I look at myself back from when I would be 80, I would think that all I am doing right now—watching the news, seeing stuff on Twitter or YouTube, and seeing content on Instagram sometimes—they are all worthless. They are all short-term lived. In the long term, they all make no sense. Obviously, you can put your mind at ease, but in a meaningful sense—some music that makes it meaningful, some art that makes it meaningful.

All life is just making ourselves meaningful. To live a life with no meaning and doing the works of what society expects is just utter BS.

Introspection can reveal far more about you than any person that tells you anything. Always introspect after a loss, after a bad day, after a good day. None of them are permanent.

The most important thing to build in this world is to have a critique of reason and to have patience and to build consistency, and to train to listen to yourself as intellect and the instincts—to control the mind.

To find meaning. To meditate. To find meaning in those far few minutes that you spend, more than the life that you live the next 18 hours.

I look back when I will be 80 and think about my youth—I don’t want to feel that I wasted it on thinking myself useless and succumbed to society, rather to be courageous and risk-taking, to put the efforts in not because it is impossible, but because it is worth trying.

One can move in the life he wishes to—only it takes courage at the moment, fuelled by the self-affirmation, to see a picture of God and pray and  after the courage we put we make a choice and see the momentum take its place.

The simple action of choosing action over inaction can change the mindset! One must see it through that all you see is the short-term benefit, and the long-term benefit of restraint is in a way more strengthening. One small action can completely change the mind. Taking control of life! Laziness always lurking. Each time we resist, we build character and strength and will. Temptation is a challenge, a test that is challenging us, that we must meet. Choosing action. Taking temptations are tests. It is the path of shaping the person we want to be.

Once we experience it, it becomes addictive.

In 10 years, what would you have—pushing yourself through this struggle or easing the path to go there?

Always weigh the long-term benefits over the short-term benefits.

Living a life worthy is all we need, and the hardest moments shape us the most.

Efforts paying off at the most is the most satisfying.

I understand that all the life I have lived through, I never really found one thing I am good at better than someone already. For all things I thought I was, I was just a mere average or slightly above one.

To all the things that they are—the best thing is that an average life is indeed a victim playing “I am never going to be good enough.” But one can make it worth it. That through my averageness I rise among the best, through a persistent way of learning, to understand and put in the efforts, and to go all the way in.

Every choice matters. Resist urges. Seek long-term. Weigh it down after 10 years.
Always for every choice, think would I be happy or alright if I did this, and reflect it back when I am 80 ?

It is through reason that one can be free.

Who, if not you, can change yourself?

The truth is you are saying yourself a story, where you are a victim, powerless...  but the actual truth is, You make your own story.

How I respond is what I can control. All excuses are holding you back. Everything is just a mental prison. All death is psychological—when you stop binding and take full responsibility. You are the creator of destiny.

- Recognize the excuse (be aware of them, pause and ask and reason—does it have power over me or is it something that I am doing to get out of responsibility?)
    
- Get rid of the excuse.
    
- Power to change is within you.
    
- Take action without hesitation, don’t wait for a perfect moment.
    

Ask why and how. Take things slow. Think it through and make it really reasonable.

To think daily about what bothers you in introspection can help you a lot to understand who you are—for 15–20 minutes daily.

> _If you're going to try, go all the way. Otherwise, don't even start. This could mean losing girlfriends, wives, relatives and maybe even your mind. It could mean not eating for three or four days. It could mean freezing on a park bench. It could mean jail. It could mean derision. It could mean mockery—isolation. Isolation is the gift. All the others are a test of your endurance, of how much you really want to do it. And, you'll do it, despite rejection and the worst odds. And it will be better than anything else you can imagine. If you're going to try, go all the way. There is no other feeling like that. You will be alone with the gods, and the nights will flame with fire. You will ride life straight to perfect laughter. It's the only good fight there is._  
> — Charles Bukowski, _What Matters Most is How Well You Walk Through the Fire_

All my life I wanted to be some sort of pseudo-intellectual, but does it really matter?

Until death, all defeat is psychological.
