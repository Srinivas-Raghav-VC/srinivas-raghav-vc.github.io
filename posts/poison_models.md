## Language models are the new drugs

### *19th April 2025*

I was thinking about this lately. It so appears that the LLMs thing has really cruxed into people so bad that people have become over-reliant on it—especially people at the start of a career path and even in the middle of it. They have become excessively over-reliant, and honestly, in some sense, people speak of it as leading to more productivity and independence for businesses and individuals who do not have access to experts.

But in the foundational sense—and _for_ the foundational—it has been very bad. In a way, it’s similar to a drug: to some extent, it can be fun, but it is intoxicating and addicting. Over-reliance on it can make the truth about _you_ invisible to your own self. That you don’t like and even hate the way you are and why you are when you look at the stuff that is build by the "so" you.

The way LLMs have grown—how strong and sharp they’ve become—is honestly amazing. They will, no doubt, help humanity answer big questions. Important ones.

And in a world where experts are often isolated in their own silos, the fact that LLMs can memorize and synthesize so much knowledge… it gives people access. It helps accelerate growth across fields. It sort of brings a union of ideas—a union I _wish_ we saw more of between real people from different fields. That kind of collaboration would solve problems a lot quicker. But...

There is real beauty in being authentic and original. The way of the LLMs, in some sense, helps in making the path a little smoother—but things can go out of hand real quick, man. And if they do, there _is_ a product on the table—but nothing that **you** have built. I mean, the ideas can be original, but the feeling of saying it’s yours feels like an imposter.

LLMs are really important in accessing information and expert knowledge—but it should be **severely** restricted for students who are still building. It appears that the implications of this in the long term can be devastating.

I am a victim of this myself. And I feel I should restrict and remove as much as I can the use of LLMs in building and coding.

They are wonderful in explaining and providing intuition for so many things… but to really write code, to write literature, to build something—

It’s in so many ways inspiring and amazing, but I guess… just build on your own and try to find the _flow_.

**TLDR**: This is a conversation with myself that I write here, and you are welcome to read my thoughts.
