---- 


i am so powerfull   
yet I fall under the scrutiny of the mind

i want to change   
but yet the mind takes it all away

i want to take the control of myself  
yet i find it difficult to fight the demon who won't   let me change for better

all i need is the grace of the gods and the courage to be me  
to fight him and triumph over him  

to fight him   
with all i have  
with all i can  

i know what to do, what is right  
yet the mind makes priorities it likes  
i wish i could be more in control,   
so to take charge of my life  

only to know it is always possible,  
cause i have a choice every god damn time
