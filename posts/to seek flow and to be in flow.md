## To seek flow and to be in flow

Was seeing a video discussing the genius pair programmers Jeff Dean and Sanjay have made through the years in Google, and the work that they have done has in literal sense shaped the modern world in ways we take for granted.

Most of the Distributed Computing, Parallel Processing, TensorFlow, and now LLMs.

Their work together had nothing but pure beauty.

What I understand is that this beauty is progressed by something known as _flow_.

Flow is defined as a state of mind where the mind and body are in complete union with the work that they are engaging in—so much so that the awareness of the world around them is diminished and they are in complete union with the work that they are doing.

I once saw this video of _flow_ being explained by a swami, and he explained it in the context of this famous book called **"Flow"** by a very difficult author to write and has a hard last name to pronounce (no disrespect). He has done some incredible, hard work and efforted work towards understanding the nature of this _flow_, and he has taken most of this context from a work of an exceptional sage known as **Patanjali**, the work being **"Raja Yoga"**, the yoga of the mind.

Yoga in simple words means "union", and the union with _whom_ is what the world of it explores in the great Hindu scriptures and spirituality.

The author finds something interesting i.e the _flow_ can be FOUND IN ANYTHING—literally anything if we balance the challenge with the skill in hand. All it takes is a mental model of divide and conquer: break the tasks easy enough that it appears too easy and then slowly build the challenge through Socratic questions and exercise. I believe one should also start thinking consciously and then think on how and why and what was the reason of its existence and maybe its implication.

Jeff Dean and Sanjay are pure humble geniuses. Their work is a perfect demonstration of _flow_, and I wondered why is it so difficult for me to find _flow_ in things? Why is it so hard to excel? It often appears that having **motive** (a reason why it is important) and (a curious reason of how it is so beautiful and elegant and has changed the world in its beauty)—this is the main one—for everything we do we always find that one reason that makes it incredibly beautiful. Maybe with the idea of union with God (the **Brahman**, the all-encompassing).

I find the rather nihilist opinion too blunt, and boring.

Having patience is an incredibly hard thing, and with the above context it is absolutely necessary to have that.  

The above reasoning can be used especially when studying something robotic, it often adds the nature of feel and authenticity and a pure passion to progress further.

Having a curious mind as a gift has to be the most incredible thing, that humans have.

**TLDR**: I am writing this stuff for me as I am speaking to myself through this way of writing and I can ask people to join in and read it, no worries.
