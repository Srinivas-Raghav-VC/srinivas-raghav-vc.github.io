---- 


i am fighthing the very man inside  
that wants me to lose myself 

i am fighting the very man inside  
that wants me not to get to my goals

i am fighting the very man inside   
that wants instant pleasure 

i am fighting the very man inside   
that won't die away fast 

i am fighting the very man inside  
for which i hope the gods help me 

i am fighting the very man inside  
that if endured will make me a better man

i may have taken him down now,   
but he may have just started, one among his infinite lifes  
only through endurance, strength and the might of the gods that i can fight and triumph over him.
